Spoon Task

1) Start an http server

On a mac open terminal, cd to the unzipped folder and execute:

'python SimpleAuthServer.py 8888'

and access through 
  user: spoon
  pass: university

(Without requiring authentication 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888' will do).

2) Access the site through the specified port e.g. http://localhost:8888/index.html.  Refresh time is every 4s.
